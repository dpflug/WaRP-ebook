# What's all this, then?

I didn't enjoy trying to read the [WaRP SRD PDF](http://www.atlas-games.com/warp/) provided by Atlas Games, so I pulled the text out and slapped some markdown on it.

WaRP is the system behind [Over the Edge](http://www.atlas-games.com/overtheedge/index.php). I've yet to try OtE, but reading through WaRP has made me want to try it.

In case this isn't clear, I have no association with Atlas Games. All their property is still theirs, etc, etc. As I understand it, the OGL gives me the right to use the document in this way.
